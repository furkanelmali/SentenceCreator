With Unity, I developed a sentence building game. The player tries to place the words appearing on the screen in the right order in the box above.

Correct placements turn green, incorrect insertions turn red. When you click the show solution button, the whole sentence is sorted in the correct order.

An algorithm has been added that will place the lines aligned in accordance with the grammatical rules of the sentence.
